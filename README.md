This App was made it in my available time. In the middle of the process i was moving to another house so for that reason i wasn't available to code on those days. 
Either way and putting the posible outcomes outside of the box, i learned something else by doing this project and i want to thank for that. 
Having a direction for "what to do" in this early stages of mine fulls me all the time.


This is an ABM project for Alkemy which simulate the management of a wallet to keep track of operations such as "Income" or "Expenses" made it for a fictional purpose.
